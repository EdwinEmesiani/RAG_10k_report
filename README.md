# RAG_10k_report
This RAG project shows strong system design, practical problem-solving, and commitment to real-world deployment. It delivers grounded, explainable insights from complex 10-K data, using robust vector storage and a full Hugging Face Spaces deployment—an applied, production-ready example.
It renders an enterprise-grade RAG system for financial intelligence which transforms unstructured 10-K filings into an interactive, citation-grounded knowledge system using embeddings, vector databases, and LLMs. Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with a Gradio UI, it enables analysts to extract strategic insights across major cloud and AI providers in seconds—replacing hours of manual document review with reliable, explainable answers.
