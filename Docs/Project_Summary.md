AI Engineer specialising in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), applied machine learning, and intelligent data systems.

I design and deploy end-to-end AI applications that combine:

Large Language Models (LLMs)

Vector databases (Chroma)

Sentence-transformer embeddings

LangChain orchestration

Gradio & Hugging Face Spaces deployment

My flagship project, RAG_10K_Report, transforms unstructured SEC 10-K filings into a citation-grounded financial Q&A system with semantic filtering and traceable answers.

Core strengths:

Production-grade AI deployment

Dependency and build troubleshooting in containerised environments

Secure API key handling and secrets management

MLOps workflows using Git, Git LFS, and CI builds

Debugging model & vector database version conflicts

I am passionate about building AI systems that are not just intelligent — but reliable, explainable, and business-ready.
